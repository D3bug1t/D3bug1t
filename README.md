# Hi, I'm Sanskaar Srivastava 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **B.Tech student in Chemical Engineering** and pursuing a **BS in Statistics and Data Science** at **IIT Kanpur**. My interests lie in the intersection of **Mathematics**, **Data Science**, and **Algorithms**, and this repository is where I document my journey toward cracking roles in **Quantitative Finance (Quant)**, **Software Engineering (SWE)**, and **Machine Learning (ML)**.

### 📘 About Me:
I am deeply fascinated by **Mathematics** and its wide range of applications, which led me to combine my love for **Data Science** and **Engineering**. This repository reflects my learning, projects, and coding endeavors as I continuously work to improve my problem-solving abilities.

### 🚀 Current Work:
- Specializing in **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**
- Active on **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/your_codeforces_id)** (Rating: **1426**)
- Research work in **Machine Learning** and **Optimization Algorithms** with collaborations from **Clemson University** and **UNSW Australia**
  
### 🔢 Speed Maths Enthusiast:
I practice **speed maths** using **Zetamac**, **Quantguide**, and **Mathdash**. I’m currently averaging a **sub-100** on Quantguide and have a **peak rating of 2565** on Mathdash.

### 📈 Quantguide Scores:
Here’s how my scores look over time. (Graph will be here!)
