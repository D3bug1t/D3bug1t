# Hey there! 👋 I'm Sanskaar Srivastava

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently a **B.Tech student in Chemical Engineering** and also pursuing a **BS in Statistics and Data Science** at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur** (IITK). My academic interests revolve around **Mathematics**, **Data Science**, and how these fields intersect to solve real-world problems. Feel free to explore my projects, coding journey, and research work!

### About Me 🚀:
I've always been fascinated by the practical applications of **Mathematics** in fields like **engineering**, **finance**, and **technology**. This interest pushed me to pursue a dual degree, blending my passion for **data analysis** and **problem-solving** with my engineering background.

This repository serves as a **living document** of my journey toward roles in **Quantitative Finance (Quant)**, **Software Engineering (SWE)**, or **Machine Learning (ML)**. Whether you're on a similar path or just curious, you're welcome to explore!

### What You'll Find Here 📚:
- **Study materials** and notes that I’ve found useful
- **Code snippets** and solutions to common problems
- **Project breakdowns** detailing my hands-on experience

### Let's Talk Code 💻:
I started coding during my first year at IITK, and my focus recently has been on **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. I’m active on **Codeforces**, where I'm currently rated as a **Specialist** with a rating of **1426**. Not stellar yet, but I'm working hard to improve! 😄

Here are some of the topics I’m focusing on:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Trees, Linked Lists, Graphs
- **Algorithms**: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms

You’ll also find me solving problems on **LeetCode** and **CodeChef**, constantly aiming to improve my skills. Let's connect if you're into competitive programming!

### Speed Maths Enthusiast ⚡:
Apart from coding, I have a special interest in **speed maths**! I practice regularly using platforms like **Zetamac**, **Quantguide**, and **Mathdash**. Currently, I’m averaging **sub-100** on Quantguide and have a **peak rating of 2565** on Mathdash. If you're a fellow speed maths enthusiast, let's compare scores! 😎

### Research and Projects 🔬:
I've had the opportunity to work on exciting research projects in **Machine Learning** and **Optimization Algorithms**. Collaborating with experts like:
- **Prof. Apparao Rao** (Clemson University, USA)
- **Dr. Harsh Vazirani** (UNSW, Australia)

These collaborations led to two published research papers:
1. **[Research Paper 1](link_to_paper_1)**: A brief description of the paper.
2. **[Research Paper 2](link_to_paper_2)**: A brief description of the paper.

Feel free to dive into these papers and reach out if you're working on something similar!

### Future Goals 🌟:
In the next few months, I plan to sharpen my skills in:
- **Non-traditional algorithms** and **optimization techniques**
- Exploring **trading algorithms** within **Quantitative Finance**

I'm also aiming to improve my **Codeforces** ranking and hopefully reach **Candidate Master** soon. If you have tips or are on a similar journey, let’s chat!
